## Library Website Redesign

When working in the library, I worked over 10 years to design a CSS style guide for our LibGuides CMS.

Some features: 

* Removed borders on boxes

* Increased readability on fonts

* Increased spacing for separation between boxes


In addition to the features, the websites were redesigned and tested for increased use. 

* Replacing text with icons 

* One page design to fit within the Chromebook browser

* Improved copyright free resources page for easier access
